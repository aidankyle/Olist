## Introduction
Olist is an e-commerce platform (similar to Shopee) that connects small businesses across Brazil's marketplaces. Merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store app and ship them directly to the customers using Olist's logistics partners. With this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), my goal is to provide an overall descriptive analysis of Olist's customer base while drilling down on the sales performance of the top performing sellers.
